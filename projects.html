            <h2>UQ Easy Go</h2>
            <p>This is a mini-program of WeChat developed by "kexing" organization, which allows users to comment courses, set deadlines of assignments, set timetable, calculate final marks and so on. We used some technicals to develop it, such as crawler
                for fetching the courses' information, databases for storing users' information, Github for version control and so on.
            </p>
            <p>I mainly took responsible for the "course commenting" function by using React.js and JavaScript, such as translating UI/UX designs into responsive and visually appealing interfaces, as a front-end developer. Additionally, there are four icons
                designed by me, which are on the home page, including "calculator" icon, "countdown" icon, "timetable" icon and "course commenting" icon.
