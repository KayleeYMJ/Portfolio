        <h1> - About Me - </h1>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Queensland with almost full scores, as a Master of Information Technology. During studying in the UQ for two years, I developed some interesting projects, including personal work and group programs. These experience
            helps me to gain some valuable experience in communication skills and technicals, which also helps me precisely and above satisfactory standards.</p>
        <p>Moreover, some partners and I developed a mini-program of WeChat, which named "UQ easy go". It allows users to comment courses, set deadlines of assignments, set timetable and so on. What stand out was we ever had about five thousand active users
            to use our mini-program. I developed it by mainly using React.js and JavaScript, such as translating UI/UX designs into responsive and visually appealing interfaces, as a front-end developer.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I have a strong passion for coding, which enable me to work effectively in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment and also motivate me to gain new knowledge quickly. Additionally, I have strong problems-solving skills and adaptability,
            which benefit for collaboration with team members in a diverse team.</p>
        <p>
            For technical skills, I specialize in React, JavaScript(ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, JQuery, JSON, Java, php, python, mysql, AWS EC3, Git, Figma and docker.
