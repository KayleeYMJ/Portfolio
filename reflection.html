        <h1>- Reflection -</h1>
        <h2>Expectation</h2>
        <section id="Expectation">
            <p>At the beginning of this semester, I would have liked to learn some knowledge about web development through DECO 7180, like web frame, JavaScript and HTML. Because I had never worked with others, I have intended to implement our program with
                other team members more efficiently and kindly, too. Besides that, I have wanted to improve my English skill.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Course Reflection</h2>
        <section id="Personal-Skill">
            <p>In fact, I consider that all my expectations have implemented through learning DECO 7180 during this semester, including both personal skill and team work skill.</p>
            <h3>- Personal Skill</h3>
            <p>For personal skill, I have learned a lot. Firstly, I have learned PHP. Actually, I had never known about PHP before. I have realized that the semantics of PHP is most same with Java or python during this semester. Also, I have used PHP to
                connect the API in the final web after studying PHP. </p>
            <p>Secondly, I have learned how to build the database of a web. The API of food trucks cannot be referenced directly like other APIs, so we have had to use another method to connect this API. At first, I had built the food trucks database successfully,
                but other team members have couldn’t use my database directly and they have considered it’s a troublesome method. So, I have changed into using PHP to connect this API, instead of database.</p>
            <p>
                Thirdly, I had never used API to implement some functions before. In fact, I didn’t know that what is the API and how to use the API. But now, I have implemented the API of food trucks, bus stops and ferry terminals in our final web. And I have understood
                that the API is like a Internet database and everyone can use.
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I have learned how to use leaflet to design a map. In our web, I have implemented that food trucks, bus stops and ferry terminals show the locations with different icons on one map and they can be controlled seperatly by a console
                to display or not. It's a difficult technology problem, because we just had learned how to use one API on the map according to workshop. After researching, I have successfully achieved our expectation. </p>
            <p>Finally, I have improved my writing and reading skills in English, because of writing some assignments and reading some academic essays. Some semantic mistakes I have never realized before have been found and changed correctly in this course.
            </p>
        </section>
        <h3>- Team Work</h3>
        <section id="Team-Work">
            <p>For team work, I have learned how to communicate with cooperators. We should have more patient for other members at any time. Also, a good team should have clear division of the whole task and timely feedback. I have understood this point
                deeply. What’s more, a team should work and produce as one entity, so there should be an integration work after all personal work completed. For example, a report can be separate into several parts for each member, but the style should
                be same in the final delivery. It’s a point that I have never realized before.</p>
            <p> At last but not least, a Hi-Fi prototyping is significant for a team project. For personal project, I believe that the prototyping isn’t important for me, because writing codes and design web can progress at same time. However, for team project,
                a Hi-Fi prototyping is very significant, because everyone has personal view and members should make sure all contents and details of project before coding. I had never realized this point before, too.
            </p>
        </section>
        <h2>Project Reflection</h2>
        <section id="Project">
            <p>In fact, I believe that our program is successful, because most of our expectations are achieved in our program. And It's a good idea for food merchants to explore good locations in order to put food trucks. It's meaningful.</p>
            <p>
                However, there is a function which cannot be implemented fully - calculating the recommended index of a location on the map by writing back-end code. We have expected that there will be a recommendation index of this location for merchants in order to
                consider whether this point is suitable to put a food truck, when the users click a place on the map in the recommendation mode. Also, we have intended to code a complex algorithm.
            </p>
            <p>The algorithm includes the following parameters:
                <bl>
                    <li>How many trucks are already in this suburb indicates how fierce the competition is. The more trucks, the lower the recommended rating will be. </li>
                    <li>
                        The average food safety rating of all trucks in this region indicates the cost of running a food truck in this suburb and the competition level—the higher the average food safety rating, the lower the recommended rating.
                    </li>
                    <li>The number of bus stops and ferry terminals in this suburb indicates the probability of passenger flow volume for the food truck. The higher the number of bus stops and ferry terminals, the higher the recommended rating.
                    </li>
                </bl>
            </p>
            <p>For the parameters of the algorithm above, the users can get comprehensive recommendation indexes in order to make a decision about where is better to put a food truck. However, we have realized that this complex algorithm is difficult for
                us, after trying several times. Thus, we have written a simple algorithm in our final project based on five selected points on the map. I may implement this function fully in the future, after learning algorithm.</p>
            <p>Besides that, I consider that the appearance isn’t beautiful enough and most elements of final web are static. I would like to learn JavaScript further in order to design more dynamic and beautiful elements.</p>
